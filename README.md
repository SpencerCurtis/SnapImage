# SnapImage
A simple example project with functionality for tapping on an image (in this example in a collection view) and having it expand to show it in a "fullscreen" style. Think tapping on a photo in the Apple Photos app.

All images shown in the collection view are fetched from https://deckofcardsapi.com/
